# Moving from Git Bash to VS Code's PowerShell Terminal

For a long time, I ignored the potential of Microsoft’s native PowerShell, opting instead for Git Bash to run Python scripts for personal projects.

Recently, I decided to explore working directly with PowerShell inside VS Code. Here are some practical notes on directory navigation and running Python scripts.

## Directory Navigation & Management

### 1. Move to the Root Directory of Your Project Drive

In my case, my project folder is located in the `D:` partition. To switch drives in PowerShell:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\System32> D:
```

This switches the session from `C:` to `D:`.

---

### 2. List Folders in a Drive

To view the structure of the current drive (for example, `D:\`) and confirm your project folder exists:

```powershell
PS D:\> dir
```

This lists all directories and files in the current location.

---

### 3. Navigate to a Specific Project Folder

Use `cd` followed by the folder name:

```powershell
PS D:\> cd "My Project"
```

If the folder name contains spaces, wrap it in quotes.

#### Pro Tip: Tab Autocompletion

Instead of typing the full folder name:

- Type `cd ` (with a space)
- Start typing the first few letters of the folder
- Press `Tab` to autocomplete
- Press `Tab` repeatedly to cycle through matching folders

Example:

```powershell
PS D:\> cd My<Tab>
```

PowerShell will automatically complete the matching directory name.

### 4. Bonus Navigation Tips

#### a) Move Up One Directory Level

```powershell
PS D:\My Project> cd ..
```

#### b) Move to Your User Home Directory

```powershell
PS D:\> cd ~
```

or simply:

```powershell
PS D:\> cd
```

Both commands take you to your user home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName`).

## Running Python Scripts in PowerShell

Assuming Python is installed and added to your system PATH, you can run a Python script from within your project directory like this:

```powershell
PS D:\My Project> python script.py
```

---

### If Python Is Not in Your PATH

You can call Python using its full executable path:

```powershell
PS D:\My Project> & "C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe" script.py
```

Notes:

- The `&` is the call operator in PowerShell.
- Quotes are required if the path contains spaces.
- `script.py` must be in the current directory (or you must provide its full path).

## Why PowerShell Over Git Bash?

- Native Windows integration  
- Better compatibility with Windows tooling  
- Rich object-based output (not just text streams)  
- Strong scripting capabilities  

For Windows-based development workflows, PowerShell can often be the more seamless option.
